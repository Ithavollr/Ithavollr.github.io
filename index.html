    <p><strong>Release Notes & Lore</strong></p>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Iðavöllr</strong>!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a unique SMP server with a unified Client instance. Once you've installed Prism and imported the zip file
      it will automatically stay up to date with all other clients and the server. Most importantly, Iðavöllr can 
      <em>only</em> be accessed through this unique Prism instance due to its network configuration and proxy. This is both
      to ensure anyone on Iðavöllr <em>means</em> to be on Iðavöllr, random scanners will never connect, and also to 
      provide an equal experience to all players on the server, with minimal manual steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Gameplay:</strong>
      <em>YOU SHOULD PROBABLY READ ME FIRST!!!</em> Iðavöllr is a world that has already been conquered. The End Dragon is
      defeated, and his vanquisher has built a library at the End where his lair once was. This library is the key to 
      Iðavöllr - each book there represents a world. Certain actions will unlock the ability to make worlds (i.e. write
      your own books). Place a book on the lecturn to set the portal destination, and jump in!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rules of Iðavöllr:</strong>
      1. Play for fun, alterior motives not welcome.
      2. Attacking the server directly (mass griefing, lag machines, etc) will result in an immediate & permanent ban.
      3. Bring your creativity! Whether new ideas or new worlds, adding to the server is the best way to play. Contributions welcome!
